# Interactive-Shell
This was done as part of assignment in "Design Of Operating System".

This repository contains code for interactive shell.

->It runs most of the commands of the original shell and adds GUI to display answers.
->The GUI attached with this shell is made using Zenity library and dialog utility.

->Some extra utility like "searchfile"  and "info" is added.
